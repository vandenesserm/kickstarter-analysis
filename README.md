# Crowdfunding Data Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide Louise, a play writer, with information to help launch a successful fundraising campaign for a play called *Fever*. To achieve this goal, data from thousands of crowdfunding campaigns were analyzed to find outcome patterns based on launch dates, funding goals, countries, campaign length, and other variables. At the end of the project, the client will be provided with conclusions drawn from the data analysis to help them develop their fundraising strategy.

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to offer the best insights into what campaigns were successful, or not successful, we analyzed different aspects of the data. For this report, we will look into the outcomes based on the launch date to look for patterns such as start date and campaign lengths as it relates to the success of a campaign. We will also look into the outcomes based on goals to look for patterns as it relates to goal amounts and outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As the data shown in the graph indicates, the most successful Kickstarter campaigns were launched in May and June. The months of October and December had the highest amounts of failed campaigns in contrast with the number of campaigns launched.


The data also indicates that theater, in particular plays, are a popular and successful type of Kickstarter campaign. Using selective filters, we can see that amongst the 671 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in the US, 412 met their goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

As the graph above shows, campaigns with higher fundraising goals were more likely to fail whereas campaigns with smaller fundraising goals tended to be more successful. Louise's budget is over $10,000.  For campaigns with goals ranging from $10,000 to 14,999, only 54.17% were successful.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Campaigns launched in May and June have a higher success rate when compared to the overall campaign launched. In contrast, campaigns launched in December have a high failure rate. Based on this information, Louise should plan to launch the crowdfunding campaign around May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Campaigns that have requested higher amounts have a higher fail rate with a smaller pledged average. Approximately 54% of campaigns with a similar budget range were successful. As the data indicates, a smaller budget would likely increase her chances of meeting her goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data presents Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 through 2017, for over 20 countries, and many categories unrelated to theater. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other helpful information we can provide Louise is related to pledging amounts. By determining the average donation, Louise can set pledge incentives to help boost pledges to her campaign.
